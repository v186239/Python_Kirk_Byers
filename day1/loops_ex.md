#Loops Ex1
----------

1.  Create a list containing the values 1-49

2.  Loop over this list, printing each value

3.  Use continue to skip over 13 (not print it)

4.  Break when you hit 39 (stop printing after this and exit the loop)

#Loops Ex2
----------

1. Use a while loop and a counter variable i.

2. Initialize i to an initial value of 0

3. Stay in the while loop until i is greater than 49

4. Increment i each time through the while loop

5. Print out i (except don't print out i when it is 13).
