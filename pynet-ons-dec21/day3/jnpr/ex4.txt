4. PyEZ RPC operations:

4a. Manually SSH to the vmx1 device and execute:

pyclass@vmx1> show interfaces terse | display xml rpc

Use this command to learn the direct RPC method name. You will use this method
name to retrieve the interface information from the device in step 4b.

4b. Open a PyEZ connection to the vmx1 device.

Execute the RPC method that you learned in step 4a. Save the output of this RPC
method call to a variable named "xml_out".

Use the following command to print out this XML output.

from lxml import etree
print(etree.tostring(xml_out, encoding="unicode", pretty_print=True))
