Write a simple function that accepts a "dev" dictionary (dictionary 
with Netmiko connetion information) and a "cmd" string to execute on the device.
Return the output of the command from the function.

Using concurrent futures ThreadPoolExecutor, spawn threads to execute 
'show ip arp' on the four Arista switches.

Wait until all threads are completed, then iterate through the results and print
the result-output.
