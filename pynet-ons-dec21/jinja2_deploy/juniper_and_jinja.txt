Use Jinja2 templating and PyEZ to configure BGP peering between juniper1 and
juniper2.

Your Jinja2 template file should look similar to the following:

--------
routing-options {
    autonomous-system {{ local_as }};
}
protocols {
    bgp {
        group external-peers {
            type external;
                neighbor {{ neighbor_ip }} {
                    peer-as {{ neighbor_as }};
                }
        }
    }
}
--------

Perform a diff operation before commiting your changes (on the staged candidate configuration).
