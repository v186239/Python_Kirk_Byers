"""
Purpose of this example is to demonstrate multiple threads
being used -- in this case up to the THREAD_POOL size.

So we submit TASKS=N to the worker pool and as threads free
up, the tasks get executed.

Use top or activity/system monitor to see a single instance
of Python being ran with a very high CPU utilization.
